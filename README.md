# Movie Sagas 


_Duration: weekend sprint

For one of our weekend challenges at prime digital academy, we were asked to create a movie database full stack app that utilizes, react, redux, redux sagas, and storage with an sql database. One of the biggest challenges of this project was getting my sagas right and familiarizing myself with the pattern of writing sagas 


### Prerequisites

Create a database called ‘movies’ (or whatever you want to call it) 
Run the database.sql file
Npm install 
Npm run server
Npm run client


## Usage


1. Click on a movie to view details! There's quite a few in there. 



## Built With

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ReactJs] (https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux] (https://redux.js.org/)
- [PostgreSQL]  (https://www.postgresql.org/)
